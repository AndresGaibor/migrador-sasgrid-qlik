# tNetezzaBulkExec

Last updated: 9/30/2026

Offers gains in performance while carrying out the Insert operations to a Netezza
database.

## tNetezzaBulkExec Standard properties

These properties are used to configure tNetezzaBulkExec running in the Standard Job framework.

The Standard
tNetezzaBulkExec component belongs to the Databases family.

The component in this framework is available in all Talend
products.

Information noteNote: This component is a specific version of a dynamic database
connector. The properties related to database settings vary depending on your database
type selection. For more information about dynamic database connectors, see [DB Generic components](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/db-generic/db-generic-component).

## Basic settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Database | Select the desired database type from the list and click Apply. |
| Property type | * Either Built-in or   Repository   . * Built-in: No property data stored   centrally. * Repository: Select the repository   file in which the properties are stored. The fields that follow are   completed automatically using the data retrieved. |
| Use an existing connection | Select this check box and in the Component List drop-down list, select the desired connection component to reuse the connection details you already defined.  Information noteNote: When a Job contains the parent Job and the child Job, do the following if you want to share an existing connection between the parent Job and the child Job (for example, to share the connection created by the parent Job with the child Job).  1. In the parent level, register the database connection to be shared    in the Basic settings view of the    connection component which creates that very database connection. 2. In the child level, use a dedicated connection component to read    that registered database connection.   For an example about how to share a database connection across Job levels, see [Sharing a database connection](/talend/r/en-US/7.3/studio-user-guide/sharing-database-connection). |
| Host | Database server IP address |
| Port | Listening port number of DB server. |
| Database | Name of the database. |
| Username and Password | DB user authentication data.  To enter the password, click the [...] button next to the password field, enter the password in double quotes in the pop-up dialog box, and click OK to save the settings. |
| Table | Name of the table to be written. Note that only one table can be written at a time and that the table must exist for the insert operation to succeed. |
| Schema and Edit Schema | * A schema is a row description. It defines the number of fields   (columns) to be processed and passed on to the next component. When you create a Spark   Job, avoid the reserved word `line` when naming the   fields. * Built-In: You create and store the schema locally for this component   only. * Repository: You have already created the schema and stored it in the   Repository. You can reuse it in various projects and Job designs. * Click Edit   schema to make changes to the schema. If the current schema is of the Repository type, three options are available:    + View schema: choose this     option to view the schema only.   + Change to built-in property:     choose this option to change the schema to Built-in for local changes.   + Update repository connection:     choose this option to change the schema stored in the repository and decide whether     to propagate the changes to all the Jobs upon completion.  If you just want to     propagate the changes to the current Job, you can select No upon completion and choose this schema metadata     again in the Repository Content     window. |
| File Name | Name of the file to be loaded.  This file should be located on the same machine where Talend Studio is installed or where the Job using tNetezzaBulkExec is deployed. |

## Advanced settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Additional JDBC Parameters | Specify additional JDBC parameters for the database connection created. This property is not available when the Use an existing connection check box in the Basic settings view is selected. |
| Field Separator | Character, string or regular expression to separate fields. |
| Escape character | Character of the row to be escaped. |
| Date format / Date delimiter | Use Date format to distinguish the way years, months and days are represented in a string. Use Date delimiter to specify the separator between date values. |
| Time format/ Time delimiter | Use Time format to distinguish the time is represented in a string. Use Time delimiter to specify the separator between time values. |
| Encoding | Select the encoding from the list or select Custom and define it manually. This field is compulsory for DB data handling. |
| Max Errors | Enter the maximum error limit that will not stop the process. |
| Skip Rows | Enter the number of rows to be skipped. |
| tStatCatcher Statistics | Select this check box to collect log data at the component level. |

## Global Variables

| Variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Global Variables | NB\_LINE: the number of rows processed. This is an After variable and it returns an integer.  ERROR\_MESSAGE: the error message generated by the component when an error occurs. This is an After variable and it returns a string. This variable functions only if the Die on error checkbox is cleared, if the component has this checkbox.  A Flow variable functions during the execution of a component while an After variable functions after the execution of the component.  To fill up a field or expression with a variable, press Ctrl+Space to access the variable list and choose the variable to use from it.  For more information about variables, see [Using contexts and variables](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/contexts-and-variables). |

## Usage

| Usage guidance | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage rule** | This component is mainly used when non particular transformation is required on the data to be loaded on to the database. |
| Dynamic settings | Click the [+] button to add a row in the table and fill the Code field with a context variable to choose your database connection dynamically from multiple connections planned in your Job. This feature is useful when you need to access database tables having the same data structure but in different databases, especially when you are working in an environment where you cannot change your Job settings, for example, when your Job has to be deployed and executed independent of Talend Studio.  The Dynamic settings table is available only when the Use an existing connection check box is selected in the Basic settings view. Once a dynamic parameter is defined, the Component List box in the Basic settings view becomes unusable.  For examples on using dynamic parameters, see [Reading data from databases through context-based dynamic connections](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/defining-context-groups/reading-data-from-databases-through-context-based-dynamic-connections) and [Reading data from different MySQL databases using dynamically loaded connection parameters](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/context/reading-data-from-different-mysql-databases-using-dynamically-loaded-connection-parameters). For more information on Dynamic settings and context variables, see [Dynamic schema](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/dynamic-schema) and [Creating a context group and define context variables in it](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/creating-context-group-and-define-context-variables-in-it). |
| Limitation | Due to license incompatibility, one or more JARs required to use this component are not provided. You can install the missing JARs for this particular component by clicking the Install button on the Component tab view. You can also find out and add all missing JARs easily on the Modules tab in the Integration perspective of Talend Studio. For details, see [Installing external modules](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/installing-external-modules). |
