# tVerticaRow

Last updated: 9/30/2026

Executes a Vertica SQL statement against a database table.

## tVerticaRow Standard properties

These properties are used to configure tVerticaRow running in the Standard Job framework.

The Standard
tVerticaRow component belongs to the Databases family.

The component in this framework is available in all Talend
products.

Information noteNote: This component is a specific version of a dynamic database
connector. The properties related to database settings vary depending on your database
type selection. For more information about dynamic database connectors, see [DB Generic components](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/db-generic/db-generic-component).

## Basic settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Database | Select the desired database type from the list and click Apply. |
| Property Type | Select the way the connection details will be set.   * Built-In: The connection details will be set   locally for this component. You need to specify the values for all   related connection properties manually. * Repository: The connection details stored   centrally in Repository > Metadata will be reused by this component.  You need to click   the [...] button next to it and in the pop-up   Repository Content dialog box, select the   connection details to be reused, and all related connection   properties will be automatically filled in. |
| Use an existing connection | Select this check box and in the Component List drop-down list, select the desired connection component to reuse the connection details you already defined.  When a Job contains the parent Job and the child Job, if you need to share an existing connection between the two levels, for example, to share the connection created by the parent Job with the child Job, you have to:   1. In the parent level, register the database connection to be shared    in the Basic settings view of the connection    component which creates that very database connection. 2. In the child level, use a dedicated connection component to read    that registered database connection.   For an example about how to share a database connection across Job levels, see [Sharing a database connection](/talend/r/en-US/7.3/studio-user-guide/sharing-database-connection). |
| Host | Enter the IP address or hostname of the database. |
| Port | Enter the listening port number of the database. |
| Database | Enter the name of the database. |
| Schema | Enter the schema of the database. |
| Username and Password | Enter the database user authentication data.  To enter the password, click the [...] button next to the password field, enter the password in double quotes in the pop-up dialog box, and click OK to save the settings. |
| Schema and Edit schema | A schema is a row description. It defines the number of fields (columns) to be processed and passed on to the next component. When you create a Spark Job, avoid the reserved word `line` when naming the fields.   * Built-In: You create and store the schema locally for this component   only. * Repository: You have already created the schema and stored it in the   Repository. You can reuse it in various projects and Job designs.   Click Edit schema to make changes to the schema. If you make changes, the schema automatically becomes built-in.   * View schema: choose this   option to view the schema only. * Change to built-in property:   choose this option to change the schema to Built-in for local changes. * Update repository connection:   choose this option to change the schema stored in the repository and decide whether   to propagate the changes to all the Jobs upon completion.  If you just want to   propagate the changes to the current Job, you can select No upon completion and choose this schema metadata   again in the Repository Content   window. |
| Table | Enter the name of the table to be processed. |
| Query Type and Query | Specify the database query statement paying particularly attention to the sequence of the fields which must correspond to the schema definition.   * Built-In: Fill in the query statement in the Query field manually or click the [...] button next to the Query field to build the statement graphically using the SQLBuilder. * Repository: Select the relevant query stored in the Repository by clicking the [...] button next to it and in the pop-up Repository Content dialog box, select the query to be used, and the Query field will be automatically filled in. |
| Die on error | Select the checkbox to stop the execution of the Job when an error occurs.  Clear the checkbox to skip any rows on error and complete the process for error-free rows.  When errors are skipped, you can collect the rows on error using a Row > Reject connection. |

## Advanced settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Additional JDBC Parameters | Specify additional JDBC parameters for the database connection created. This property is not available when the Use an existing connection check box in the Basic settings view is selected. |
| Propagate record set | Select this check box to propagate the result of the query to the output flow. From the use column list displayed, you need to select a column into which the query result will be inserted.  This option allows the component to have a different schema from that of the preceding component. Moreover, the column that holds the query's recordset should be set to the Object type and this component is usually followed by a tParseRecordSet component. |
| Use PreparedStatement | Select this check box if you want to query the database using a prepared statement. In the Set PreparedStatement Parameters table displayed, specify the value for each parameter represented by a question mark `?` in the SQL statement defined in the Query field.   * Parameter Index: the position of the parameter in the SQL   statement. * Parameter Type: the data type of the parameter. * Parameter Value: the value of the parameter.   For a related use case of this property, see [Using PreparedStatement objects to query data](/talend/en-US/components/8.0/mysql/tmysqlrow-tparserecordset-tfileinputdelimited-tfileoutputdelimited-using-preparedstatement-objects-to-query-data-standard-component-this). |
| Commit every | Specify the number of rows to be processed before committing batches of rows together into the database.  This option ensures transaction quality (but not rollback) and, above all, better performance at executions. |
| tStatCatcher Statistics | Select this checkbox to gather the Job processing metadata at the Job level as well as at each component level. |

## Global Variables

| Variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NB\_LINE\_DELETED | The number of rows deleted. This is an After variable and it returns an integer. |
| NB\_LINE\_INSERTED | The number of rows inserted. This is an After variable and it returns an integer. |
| NB\_LINE\_UPDATED | The number of rows updated. This is an After variable and it returns an integer. |
| QUERY | The query statement being processed. This is a Flow variable and it returns a string. |
| ERROR\_MESSAGE | The error message generated by the component when an error occurs. This is an After variable and it returns a string. |

## Usage

| Usage guidance | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage rule** | This component offers the flexibility of the DB query and covers all possible SQL queries.  Talend Studio and the Vertica database create very fast and affordable data warehouse and data mart applications. For more information about how to configure *Talend Studio* to connect to Vertica, see [Talend and HP Vertica Tips and Techniques](https://www.vertica.com/kb/Vertica-Integration-with-Talend-Connection-Guide/Content/Partner/Vertica-Integration-with-Talend-Connection-Guide.htm). |
| Dynamic settings | Click the [+] button to add a row in the table and fill the Code field with a context variable to choose your database connection dynamically from multiple connections planned in your Job. This feature is useful when you need to access database tables having the same data structure but in different databases, especially when you are working in an environment where you cannot change your Job settings, for example, when your Job has to be deployed and executed independent of Talend Studio.  The Dynamic settings table is available only when the Use an existing connection check box is selected in the Basic settings view. Once a dynamic parameter is defined, the Component List box in the Basic settings view becomes unusable.  For examples on using dynamic parameters, see [Reading data from databases through context-based dynamic connections](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/defining-context-groups/reading-data-from-databases-through-context-based-dynamic-connections) and [Reading data from different MySQL databases using dynamically loaded connection parameters](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/context/reading-data-from-different-mysql-databases-using-dynamically-loaded-connection-parameters). For more information on Dynamic settings and context variables, see [Dynamic schema](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/dynamic-schema) and [Creating a context group and define context variables in it](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/creating-context-group-and-define-context-variables-in-it). |
