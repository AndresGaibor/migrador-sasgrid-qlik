# tAS400LastInsertId

Last updated: 9/30/2026

Obtains the primary key value of the record that was last inserted in an AS/400
table.

tAS400LastInsertId fetches the last inserted ID from a
selected AS/400 Connection.

Information noteNote: If you have installed the 8.0.1-R2023-03 Talend Studio Monthly
update or a later one delivered by Talend, be sure
to select the Return generated keys option in the
Advanced settings view of the tAS400Output components in the same
Job so that the tAS400LastInsertId component works properly.

## tAS400LastInsertId Standard properties

These properties are used to configure tAS400LastInsertId running in the Standard Job framework.

The Standard
tAS400LastInsertId component belongs to the Databases family.

The component in this framework is available in all Talend
products.

Information noteNote: This component is a specific version of a dynamic database
connector. The properties related to database settings vary depending on your database
type selection. For more information about dynamic database connectors, see [DB Generic components](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/db-generic/db-generic-component).

## Basic settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Database | Select the desired database type from the list and click Apply. |
| Schema and Edit Schema | A schema is a row description. It defines the number of fields (columns) to be processed and passed on to the next component. When you create a Spark Job, avoid the reserved word `line` when naming the fields.   * Built-in: You create and store the   schema locally for this component only. For more information about a component schema in its Basic settings tab, see [Basic settings tab](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/basic-settings-tab). * Repository: You have already created   the schema and stored it in the Repository. You can reuse it in various   projects and Job flow charts. For more information about a component schema in its Basic settings tab, see [Basic settings tab](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/basic-settings-tab).   Click Edit schema to make changes to the schema. If the current schema is of the Repository type, three options are available:   * View schema: choose this   option to view the schema only. * Change to built-in property:   choose this option to change the schema to Built-in for local changes. * Update repository connection:   choose this option to change the schema stored in the repository and decide whether   to propagate the changes to all the Jobs upon completion.  If you just want to   propagate the changes to the current Job, you can select No upon completion and choose this schema metadata   again in the Repository Content   window. |
| Component list | Select the relevant tAS400Connection component in the list if more than one connection is planned for the current job. |

## Usage

| Usage guidance | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage rule** | This component is to be used as an intermediary component. |
| Dynamic settings | Click the [+] button to add a row in the table and fill the Code field with a context variable to choose your database connection dynamically from multiple connections planned in your Job. This feature is useful when you need to access database tables having the same data structure but in different databases, especially when you are working in an environment where you cannot change your Job settings, for example, when your Job has to be deployed and executed independent of Talend Studio.  Once a dynamic parameter is defined, the Component List box in the Basic settings view becomes unusable.  For examples on using dynamic parameters, see [Reading data from databases through context-based dynamic connections](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/defining-context-groups/reading-data-from-databases-through-context-based-dynamic-connections) and [Reading data from different MySQL databases using dynamically loaded connection parameters](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/context/reading-data-from-different-mysql-databases-using-dynamically-loaded-connection-parameters). For more information on Dynamic settings and context variables, see [Dynamic schema](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/dynamic-schema) and [Creating a context group and define context variables in it](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/creating-context-group-and-define-context-variables-in-it). |
