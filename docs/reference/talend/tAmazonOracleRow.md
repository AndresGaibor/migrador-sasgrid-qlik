# tAmazonOracleRow

Last updated: 9/30/2026

Executes the SQL query stated onto the specified database.

Depending on the nature of the query and the database,
tAmazonOracleRow acts on the actual DB structure or on the data
(although without handling data). The SQLBuilder tool helps you write easily your SQL
statements. tAmazonOracleRow is the specific component for this
database query. The row suffix means the component implements a flow in the Job design
although it does not provide output.

## tAmazonOracleRow Standard properties

These properties are used to configure tAmazonOracleRow running in the Standard Job framework.

The Standard
tAmazonOracleRow component belongs to the Cloud and the Databases families.

The component in this framework is available in all Talend
products.

Information noteNote: This component is a specific version of a dynamic database
connector. The properties related to database settings vary depending on your database
type selection. For more information about dynamic database connectors, see [DB Generic components](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/db-generic/db-generic-component).

## Basic settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Database | Select the desired database type from the list and click Apply. |
| Property type | * Either Built-in or Repository. * Built-in: No property data stored   centrally. * Repository: Select the repository   file in which the properties are stored. The fields that follow are   completed automatically using the data retrieved. |
| Use an existing connection | Select this check box and in the Component List drop-down list, select the desired connection component to reuse the connection details you already defined.  Information noteNote: When a Job contains the parent Job and the child Job, do the following if you want to share an existing connection between the parent Job and the child Job (for example, to share the connection created by the parent Job with the child Job).  1. In the parent level, register the database connection to be shared    in the Basic settings view of the    connection component which creates that very database connection. 2. In the child level, use a dedicated connection component to read    that registered database connection.   For an example about how to share a database connection across Job levels, see [Sharing a database connection](/talend/r/en-US/7.3/studio-user-guide/sharing-database-connection). |
| Connection type | Drop-down list of available drivers. |
| Host | Database server IP address |
| Port | Listening port number of DB server. |
| Database | Name of the database |
| Username and Password | DB user authentication data.  To enter the password, click the [...] button next to the password field, enter the password in double quotes in the pop-up dialog box, and click OK to save the settings. |
| Schema and Edit Schema | * A schema is a row description, i.e. it defines the number of   fields to be processed and passed on to the next component. The   schema is either Built-in or stored   remotely in the Repository. * Built-in: The schema is created   and stored locally for this component only. For more information about a component schema in its Basic settings tab, see [Basic settings tab](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/basic-settings-tab). * Repository: The schema already   exists and is stored in the Repository, hence can be reused. For more information about a component schema in its Basic settings tab, see [Basic settings tab](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/basic-settings-tab). |
| Query type | * Either Built-in or   Repository   . * Built-in: Fill in manually the   query statement or build it graphically using SQLBuilder * Repository: Select the relevant   query stored in the Repository. The Query field gets accordingly   filled in. |
| Query | Enter your DB query paying particularly attention to properly sequence the fields in order to match the schema definition. |
| Use NB\_LINE\_ | This option allows you feed the variable with the number of rows inserted/updated/deleted to the next component or subJob. This field only applies if the query entered in Query field is a INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE query.  * NONE: does not feed   the variable. * INSERTED: feeds the   variable with the number of rows inserted. * UPDATED: feeds the   variable with the number of rows updated. * DELETED: feeds the   variable with the number of rows deleted. |
| Die on error | This check box is selected by default. Clear the check box to skip the row on error and complete the process for error-free rows. If needed, you can retrieve the rows on error via a Row > Rejects link. |

## Advanced settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Propagate QUERY's recordset | Select this check box to insert the result of the query into a COLUMN of the current flow. Select this column from the use column list.  Information noteNote: This option allows the component to have a different schema from that of the preceding component. Moreover, the column that holds the QUERY's recordset should be set to the type of *Object* and this component is usually followed by tParseRecordSet. |
| Use PreparedStatement | Select this check box if you want to query the database using a PreparedStatement. In the Set PreparedStatement Parameter table, define the parameters represented by "?" in the SQL instruction of the Query field in the Basic Settings tab.  Parameter Index: Enter the parameter position in the SQL instruction.  Parameter Type: Enter the parameter type.  Parameter Value: Enter the parameter value.    Information noteNote: This option is very useful if you need to exe­cute the same query several times. Performance levels are increased |
| Commit every | Number of rows to be completed before committing batches of rows together into the DB. This option ensures transaction quality (but not rollback) and above all better performance on executions. |
| tStatCatcher Statistics | Select this check box to collect log data at the component level. |

## Global Variables

| Variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Global Variables | QUERY: the query statement being processed. This is a Flow variable and it returns a string.  NB\_LINE\_UPDATED: the number of rows updated. This is an After variable and it returns an integer.  NB\_LINE\_INSERTED: the number of rows inserted. This is an After variable and it returns an integer.  NB\_LINE\_DELETED: the number of rows deleted. This is an After variable and it returns an integer.  ERROR\_MESSAGE: the error message generated by the component when an error occurs. This is an After variable and it returns a string. This variable functions only if the Die on error checkbox is cleared, if the component has this checkbox.  A Flow variable functions during the execution of a component while an After variable functions after the execution of the component.  To fill up a field or expression with a variable, press Ctrl+Space to access the variable list and choose the variable to use from it.  For more information about variables, see [Using contexts and variables](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/contexts-and-variables). |

## Usage

| Usage guidance | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage rule** | This component offers the flexibility of the DB query and covers all possible SQL queries. |
| Dynamic settings | Click the [+] button to add a row in the table and fill the Code field with a context variable to choose your database connection dynamically from multiple connections planned in your Job. This feature is useful when you need to access database tables having the same data structure but in different databases, especially when you are working in an environment where you cannot change your Job settings, for example, when your Job has to be deployed and executed independent of Talend Studio.  The Dynamic settings table is available only when the Use an existing connection check box is selected in the Basic settings view. Once a dynamic parameter is defined, the Component List box in the Basic settings view becomes unusable.  For examples on using dynamic parameters, see [Reading data from databases through context-based dynamic connections](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/defining-context-groups/reading-data-from-databases-through-context-based-dynamic-connections) and [Reading data from different MySQL databases using dynamically loaded connection parameters](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/context/reading-data-from-different-mysql-databases-using-dynamically-loaded-connection-parameters). For more information on Dynamic settings and context variables, see [Dynamic schema](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/dynamic-schema) and [Creating a context group and define context variables in it](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/creating-context-group-and-define-context-variables-in-it). |
