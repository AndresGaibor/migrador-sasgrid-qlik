# tAccessInput

Last updated: 9/30/2026

Reads a database and extracts fields based on a query.

tAccessInput executes a DB query with a strictly defined statement
which must correspond to the schema definition. Then it passes on the field list to the
next component via a Row > Main
connection.

## tAccessInput Standard properties

These properties are used to configure tAccessInput running in the Standard Job framework.

The Standard
tAccessInput component belongs to the Databases family.

The component in this framework is available in all Talend
products.

Information noteNote: This component is a specific version of a dynamic database
connector. The properties related to database settings vary depending on your database
type selection. For more information about dynamic database connectors, see [DB Generic components](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/db-generic/db-generic-component).

## Basic settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Database | Select the desired database type from the list and click Apply. |
| Property type | Either Built-in or Repository .   * Built-in: No property data stored   centrally. * Repository: Select the repository   file in which the properties are stored. The fields that follow are   completed automatically using the data retrieved. |
|  | Click this icon to open a database connection wizard and store the database connection parameters you set in the component Basic settings view.  For more information about setting up and storing database connection parameters, see [Centralizing database metadata](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/centralizing-database-metadata). |
| Use an existing connection | Select this check box and in the Component List drop-down list, select the desired connection component to reuse the connection details you already defined.  Information noteNote: When a Job contains the parent Job and the child Job, do the following if you want to share an existing connection between the parent Job and the child Job (for example, to share the connection created by the parent Job with the child Job).  1. In the parent level, register the database connection to be shared    in the Basic settings view of the    connection component which creates that very database connection. 2. In the child level, use a dedicated connection component to read    that registered database connection.   For an example about how to share a database connection across Job levels, see [Sharing a database connection](/talend/r/en-US/7.3/studio-user-guide/sharing-database-connection). |
| Database | Name of the database. |
| Username and Password | DB user authentication data.  To enter the password, click the [...] button next to the password field, enter the password in double quotes in the pop-up dialog box, and click OK to save the settings. |
| Schema and Edit schema | A schema is a row description. It defines the number of fields (columns) to be processed and passed on to the next component. When you create a Spark Job, avoid the reserved word `line` when naming the fields.  This component offers the advantage of the dynamic schema feature. This allows you to retrieve unknown columns from source files or to copy batches of columns from a source without mapping each column individually. For further information about dynamic schemas, see [Dynamic schema](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/dynamic-schema).  This dynamic schema feature is designed for the purpose of retrieving unknown columns of a table and is recommended to be used for this purpose only; it is not recommended for the use of creating tables.   * Built-in: The schema is created   and stored locally for this component only. * Repository: The schema already   exists and is stored in the Repository, hence can be reused.   Click Edit schema to make changes to the schema. If the current schema is of the Repository type, three options are available:   * View schema: choose this   option to view the schema only. * Change to built-in property:   choose this option to change the schema to Built-in for local changes. * Update repository connection:   choose this option to change the schema stored in the repository and decide whether   to propagate the changes to all the Jobs upon completion.  If you just want to   propagate the changes to the current Job, you can select No upon completion and choose this schema metadata   again in the Repository Content   window. |
| Table Name | Enter the name of the table to retrieve data from. |
| Query type and Query | Enter your DB query paying particularly attention to properly sequence the fields in order to match the schema definition.  *If using the dynamic schema feature, the SELECT query must include the \* wildcard, to retrieve all of the columns from the table selected.* |

## Advanced settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Additional JDBC parameters | Specify additional connection properties for the DB connection you are creating. This option is not available if you have selected the Use an existing connection check box in the Basic settings. |
| tStat Catcher Statistics | Select this check box to collect log data at the component level. |
| Trim all the String/Char columns | Select this check box to remove leading and trailing whitespace from all the String/Char columns. |
| Trim column | Remove leading and trailing whitespace from defined columns. |

## Global Variables

| Variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Global Variables | NB\_LINE: the number of rows processed. This is an After variable and it returns an integer.  QUERY: the query statement being processed. This is a Flow variable and it returns a string.  ERROR\_MESSAGE: the error message generated by the component when an error occurs. This is an After variable and it returns a string. This variable functions only if the Die on error checkbox is cleared, if the component has this checkbox.  A Flow variable functions during the execution of a component while an After variable functions after the execution of the component.  To fill up a field or expression with a variable, press Ctrl+Space to access the variable list and choose the variable to use from it.  For more information about variables, see [Using contexts and variables](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/contexts-and-variables). |

## Usage

| Usage guidance | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage rule** | This component offers the flexibility benefit of the DB query and covers all possible SQL queries. |
| Dynamic settings | Click the [+] button to add a row in the table and fill the Code field with a context variable to choose your database connection dynamically from multiple connections planned in your Job. This feature is useful when you need to access database tables having the same data structure but in different databases, especially when you are working in an environment where you cannot change your Job settings, for example, when your Job has to be deployed and executed independent of Talend Studio.  The Dynamic settings table is available only when the Use an existing connection check box is selected in the Basic settings view. Once a dynamic parameter is defined, the Component List box in the Basic settings view becomes unusable.  For examples on using dynamic parameters, see [Reading data from databases through context-based dynamic connections](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/defining-context-groups/reading-data-from-databases-through-context-based-dynamic-connections) and [Reading data from different MySQL databases using dynamically loaded connection parameters](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/context/reading-data-from-different-mysql-databases-using-dynamically-loaded-connection-parameters). For more information on Dynamic settings and context variables, see [Dynamic schema](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/dynamic-schema) and [Creating a context group and define context variables in it](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/creating-context-group-and-define-context-variables-in-it). |
| Limitation | If you are using an ODBC driver, you need to work with Java 7, and make sure that your JVM and ODBC versions match up: both 64-bit or 32-bit.  When working with Java 8, this component supports only the General collation mode of Access.  From 8.0.1-R2022-11 monthly release onward, this component uses hsql.2.7.1.jar, a module built in JDK 11, only Java 11 and higher versions are supported. |

# Inserting data in parent/child tables

Last updated: 9/30/2026

The following Job is dedicated to advanced database users, who want to carry out
multiple table insertions using a parent table *Table1* to generate
two child tables: *Name* and *Birthday*.

* In Access 2007, create an Access database named
  *Database1*.
* Once the Access database is created, create a table named
  *Table1* with two column headings:
  *Name* and *Birthday*.

Back into the 
Integration
 perspective of *Talend Studio*,
the Job requires twelve components including tAccessConnection, tAccessCommit,
tAccessInput, tAccessOutput and tAccessClose.

* Drop the following components from the Palette to the design workspace: tFileList, tFileInputDelimited,
  tMap, tAccessOutput (two), tAccessInput (two), tAccessCommit, tAccessClose and
  tLogRow (x2).
* Connect the tFileList component to the input
  file component using an Iterate link. Thus, the
  name of the file to be processed will be dynamically filled in from the
  tFileList directory using a global
  variable.
* Connect the tFileInputDelimited component to
  the tMap component and dispatch the flow
  between the two output Access components. Use a Row link for each of these connections representing the main
  data flow.
* Set the tFileList component properties, such
  as the directory where files will be fetched from.
* Add a tAccessConnection component and
  connect it to the starter component of this Job. In this example, the tFileList component uses an OnComponentOk link to define the execution order.
* In the tAccessConnection
  Component view, set the connection details manually or fetch them from the Repository if you centrally store them as a Metadata
  DB connection entry. For more information about Metadata, see [Managing metadata in Talend Studio](/talend/r/Lfrx8uSM%7EUd8zWd9BsWB5g/dd4mXJkGs_3Ny4Aamc784g).
* In the tFileInputDelimited
  component's Basic settings view, press
  Ctrl+Space bar to access the variable list.
  Set the File Name field to the global
  variable: *tFileList\_1.CURRENT\_FILEPATH*. For more information
  about using variables, see [Using variables in a Job or Route](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/using-variables-in-job-or-route).

* Set the rest of the fields as usual, defining the row and field separators
  according to your file structure.
* Then set the schema manually through the Edit
  schema dialog box or select the schema from the
  Repository
  . Make sure the data
  type is correctly set, in accordance with the nature of the data
  processed.
* In the tMap Output area, add
  two output tables, one called *Name* for the *Name* table, the second called *Birthday*, for the *Birthday* table. For more information about the
  tMap component, see [tMap operations](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/tmap-operation).
* Drag the *Name* column from the Input area, and drop it to the *Name* table.
* Drag the *Birthday* column from the Input area, and drop it to the *Birthday*
  table.

* Then connect the output row links to distribute the flow correctly to the
  relevant DB output components.
* In each of the tAccessOutput components'
  Basic settings view, select the Use an existing connection check box to retrieve the
  tAccessConnection details.

* Set the Table name making sure it
  corresponds to the correct table, in this example either
  *Name* or *Birthday*.
* Select Default
  from the Action on table drop-down list.
  This is because the tables already exist and no operation is needed for the
  tables.
* Select Insert as Action on data for both output components.
* Click on Sync columns to retrieve the schema
  set in the tMap.
* Then connect the first tAccessOutput
  component to the first tAccessInput component
  using an OnComponentOk link.
* In each of the tAccessInput components'
  Basic settings view, select the Use an existing connection check box to retrieve the
  distributed data flow. Then set the schema manually through Edit schema dialog box.
* Then set the Table Name accordingly. In
  tAccessInput\_1, this will be
  *Name*.
* Click on the Guess Query.
* Connect each tAccessInput component to
  tLogRow component with a Row > Main link.
  In each of the tLogRow components' basic settings view, select Table in the Mode field.
* Add the tAccessCommit component below the
  tFileList component in the design workspace
  and connect them together using an OnComponentOk link in order to terminate the Job with the
  transaction commit.
* In the basic settings view of tAccessCommit component and from the Component list, select the connection to be used,
  tAccessConnection\_1 in this
  scenario.
* Save your Job and press F6 to execute
  it.

The parent table *Table1* is reused to generate the
*Name* table and *Birthday* table.
