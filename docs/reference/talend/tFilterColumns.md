# tFilterColumns properties for Apache Spark Batch

Last updated: 9/30/2026

These properties are used to configure tFilterColumns running in the Spark Batch Job framework.

The Spark Batch
tFilterColumns component belongs to the Processing family.

The component in this framework is available in all
subscription-based Talend products
with Big Data and Talend Data Fabric.

## Basic settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Schema and Edit Schema | * A schema is a row description. It defines the number of fields   (columns) to be processed and passed on to the next component. When you create a Spark   Job, avoid the reserved word `line` when naming the   fields.  Click Edit   schema to make changes to the schema. If the current schema is of the Repository type, three options are available:    + View schema: choose this     option to view the schema only.   + Change to built-in property:     choose this option to change the schema to Built-in for local changes.   + Update repository connection:     choose this option to change the schema stored in the repository and decide whether     to propagate the changes to all the Jobs upon completion.  If you just want to     propagate the changes to the current Job, you can select No upon completion and choose this schema metadata     again in the Repository Content     window. Click Sync columns to retrieve the   schema from the previous component in the Job. * Built-In: You create and store the schema locally for this component   only. * Repository: You have already created the schema and stored it in the   Repository. You can reuse it in various projects and Job designs. |

## Usage

| Usage guidance | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage rule** | This component is used as an intermediate step.  This component, along with the Spark Batch component Palette it belongs to, appears only when you are creating a Spark Batch Job.  Note that in this documentation, unless otherwise explicitly stated, a scenario presents only Standard Jobs, that is to say traditional  Talend  data integration Jobs. |
| Spark Connection | In the Spark Configuration tab in the Run view, define the connection to a given Spark cluster for the whole Job. In addition, since the Job expects its dependent jar files for execution, you must specify the directory in the file system to which these jar files are transferred so that Spark can access these files:  * Yarn mode (Yarn client or Yarn cluster):   + When using Google Dataproc, specify a bucket in the     Google Storage staging bucket     field in the Spark configuration     tab.   + When using HDInsight, specify the blob to be used for Job     deployment in the Windows Azure Storage     configuration area in the Spark     configuration tab.   + When using Altus, specify the S3 bucket or the Azure     Data Lake Storage for Job deployment in the Spark     configuration tab.   + When using on-premises distributions, use     the configuration component corresponding to the file system     your cluster is using. Typically, this system is HDFS and so     use [tHDFSConfiguration](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/hdfs/thdfsconfiguration). * Standalone mode: use the   configuration component corresponding to the file system your cluster is   using, such as [tHDFSConfiguration Apache Spark Batch](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/hdfs/thdfsconfiguration-properties-for-apache-spark-batch) or [tS3Configuration Apache Spark Batch](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/amazon-s3/ts3configuration-properties-for-apache-spark-batch).  If you are using Databricks without any configuration component present   in your Job, your business data is written directly in DBFS (Databricks   Filesystem).  This connection is effective on a per-Job basis. |

# tFilterColumns properties for Apache Spark Structured Streaming

Last updated: 9/30/2026

[Preview](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/cloud-services/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Introduction/feature-preview-program-overview.htm)

Use these properties to configure tFilterColumns running in
the Spark Structured Streaming Job framework.

The Spark Structured Streaming
tFilterColumns component belongs to the Processing family. tFilterColumns excludes specific columns from a streaming
dataset by keeping only the columns defined in the output schema. Any columns present in the
input but missing in the output schema are automatically removed.

The streaming version of this component is available in Talend Real-Time Big Data Platform and in
Talend Data Fabric.

## Basic settings

If you make changes, the schema automatically becomes built-in.   * View schema: choose this   option to view the schema only. * Change to built-in property:   choose this option to change the schema to Built-in for local changes. * Update repository connection:   choose this option to change the schema stored in the repository and decide whether   to propagate the changes to all the Jobs upon completion.  If you just want to   propagate the changes to the current Job, you can select No upon completion and choose this schema metadata   again in the Repository Content   window. |

# tFilterColumns Standard properties

Last updated: 9/30/2026

These properties are used to configure tFilterColumns running in the Standard Job framework.

The Standard
tFilterColumns component belongs to the Processing family.

The component in this framework is available in all Talend
products.

## Basic settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Schema and Edit Schema | * A schema is a row description. It defines the number of fields   (columns) to be processed and passed on to the next component. When you create a Spark   Job, avoid the reserved word `line` when naming the   fields.  Click Edit   schema to make changes to the schema.

If you just want to     propagate the changes to the current Job, you can select No upon completion and choose this schema metadata     again in the Repository Content     window. Click Sync columns to retrieve   the schema from the previous component in the Job.  This component offers the advantage of the   dynamic schema feature. This allows you to retrieve unknown columns from source   files or to copy batches of columns from a source without mapping each column   individually. For further information about dynamic schemas, see [Dynamic schema](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/dynamic-schema).  This   dynamic schema feature is designed for the purpose of retrieving unknown columns of a   table and is recommended to be used for this purpose only; it is not recommended for the   use of creating tables. * Built-In: You create and store the schema locally for this component   only. * Repository: You have already created the schema and stored it in the   Repository. You can reuse it in various projects and Job designs. |

## Advanced settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| tStatCatcher Statistics | Select this check box to gather the Job processing metadata at the Job level as well as at each component level. |

## Global Variables

| Variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Global Variables | ERROR\_MESSAGE: the error message generated by the component when an error occurs. This is an After variable and it returns a string. This variable functions only if the Die on error checkbox is cleared, if the component has this checkbox.  NB\_LINE: the number of rows read by an input component or transferred to an output component. This is an After variable and it returns an integer.  A Flow variable functions during the execution of a component while an After variable functions after the execution of the component.  To fill up a field or expression with a variable, press Ctrl+Space to access the variable list and choose the variable to use from it.  For more information about variables, see [Using contexts and variables](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/contexts-and-variables). |

## Usage

| Usage guidance | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage rule** | This component is not startable (green background) and it requires an output component. |
