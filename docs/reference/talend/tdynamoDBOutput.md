# tDynamoDBOutput properties for Apache Spark Batch

Last updated: 9/30/2026

These properties are used to configure tDynamoDBOutput running in the Spark Batch Job framework.

The Spark Batch
tDynamoDBOutput component belongs to the Databases family.

The component in this framework is available in all
subscription-based Talend products
with Big Data and Talend Data Fabric.

This component is not supported with Spark 4.0.x.

## Basic settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Use an existing connection | Select this check box and in the Component List drop-down list, select the desired connection component to reuse the connection details you already defined. |
| Inherit credentials from AWS role | Select this checkbox to leverage the instance profile credentials. These credentials can be used on Amazon EC2 instances, and are delivered through the Amazon EC2 metadata service. To use this option, your Job must be running within Amazon EC2 or other services that can leverage IAM Roles for access to resources. For more information, see [Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications Running on Amazon EC2 Instances](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html).  Information noteNote: This option is available when Use an existing connection is cleared. |
| Access Key | Enter the access key ID that uniquely identifies an AWS Account. For further information about how to get your Access Key and Secret Key, see [Getting Your AWS Access Keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/get-aws-keys.html).  Information noteNote: This option is available when Use an existing connection and  Inherit credentials from AWS role are cleared. |
| Secret Key | Enter the secret access key, constituting the security credentials in combination with the access Key.  To enter the secret key, click the [...] button next to the secret key field, and then in the pop-up dialog box enter the password between double quotes and click OK to save the settings.  Information noteNote: This option is available when Use an existing connection and  Inherit credentials from AWS role are cleared. |
| Use End Point | Select this check box and in the Server URL field displayed, specify the Web service URL of the DynamoDB database service. |
| Region | Specify the AWS region by selecting or entering a region name between double quotation marks (e.g. *"us-east-1"*). For more information about the AWS Region, see [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region). |
| Schema and Edit schema | * A schema is a row description. It defines the number of fields   (columns) to be processed and passed on to the next component. When you create a Spark   Job, avoid the reserved word `line` when naming the   fields.    + Built-In: You create and store the schema locally for this component     only.   + Repository: You have already created the schema and stored it in the     Repository. You can reuse it in various projects and Job designs. * Click Edit   schema to make changes to the schema. If the current schema is of the Repository type, three options are available:    + View schema: choose this     option to view the schema only.   + Change to built-in property:     choose this option to change the schema to Built-in for local changes.   + Update repository connection:     choose this option to change the schema stored in the repository and decide whether     to propagate the changes to all the Jobs upon completion.  If you just want to     propagate the changes to the current Job, you can select No upon completion and choose this schema metadata     again in the Repository Content     window. |
| Table Name | Specify the name of the table in which you need to write data. This table must already exist. |
| Die on error | Select the checkbox to stop the execution of the Job when an error occurs. |

## Advanced settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Throughput write percent | Enter, without using quotation marks, the percentage (expressed in decimal) to be used of the write capacity pre-defined in Amazon. For further information about this write capacity, see [Provision throughput for write](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ProvisionedThroughput.html#HowItWorks.ProvisionedThroughput.Writes). |
| Advanced properties | Add properties to define extra operations you need tDynamoDBOutput to perform when writing data.  This table is present for future evolution of the component and using it requires the high-level knowledge of DynamoDB development. Currently, there are no interesting user configurable properties. |

## Usage

| Usage guidance | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage rule** | This component is used as an end component and requires an input link.  This component should use a tDynamoDBConfiguration component present in the same Job to connect to a DynamoDB database. You need to drop a tDynamoDBConfiguration component alongside this component and configure the Basic settings of this component to use tDynamoDBConfiguration.  This component, along with the Spark Batch component Palette it belongs to, appears only when you are creating a Spark Batch Job.  Note that in this documentation, unless otherwise explicitly stated, a scenario presents only Standard Jobs, that is to say traditional  Talend  data integration Jobs. |
| Spark Connection | In the Spark Configuration tab in the Run view, define the connection to a given Spark cluster for the whole Job. In addition, since the Job expects its dependent jar files for execution, you must specify the directory in the file system to which these jar files are transferred so that Spark can access these files:  * Yarn mode (Yarn client or Yarn cluster):   + When using Google Dataproc, specify a bucket in the     Google Storage staging bucket     field in the Spark configuration     tab.   + When using HDInsight, specify the blob to be used for Job     deployment in the Windows Azure Storage     configuration area in the Spark     configuration tab.   + When using Altus, specify the S3 bucket or the Azure     Data Lake Storage for Job deployment in the Spark     configuration tab.   + When using on-premises distributions, use     the configuration component corresponding to the file system     your cluster is using. Typically, this system is HDFS and so     use [tHDFSConfiguration](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/hdfs/thdfsconfiguration). * Standalone mode: use the   configuration component corresponding to the file system your cluster is   using, such as [tHDFSConfiguration Apache Spark Batch](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/hdfs/thdfsconfiguration-properties-for-apache-spark-batch) or [tS3Configuration Apache Spark Batch](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/amazon-s3/ts3configuration-properties-for-apache-spark-batch).  If you are using Databricks without any configuration component present   in your Job, your business data is written directly in DBFS (Databricks   Filesystem).  This connection is effective on a per-Job basis. |
