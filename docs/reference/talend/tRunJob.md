# tRunJob

Last updated: 9/30/2026

Manages complex Job systems which need to execute one Job after
another.

tRunJob executes the Job called in the
component's properties, in the frame of the context defined.

Information noteWarning: Using recursive Jobs in tRunJob components
is not supported any more for new projects from Talend 8.0
onwards, as they are likely to cause performance issues when building Jobs. For more
information, see [Configuring build settings](https://help.qlik.com/talend/en-US/studio-user-guide/8.0-R2024-12/configure-build-settings).

For the latest version, see [Setting up the Java version to build artifacts in Talend Studio](https://help.qlik.com/talend/en-US/studio-user-guide/8.0/setting-compiler-compliance-level).

# tRunJob Standard properties

Last updated: 9/30/2026

These properties are used to configure tRunJob running in the
Standard Job framework.

The Standard
tRunJob component belongs to the System
and the Orchestration families.

The component in this framework is available in all Talend
products.

Information noteWarning:

The tRunJob component is supported with limitations, which means
that only S4 (Minor) support cases are accepted and no patches are provided. If you
use tRunJob within Data Services and Routes (with
cTalendJob), support is provided on a "best effort" basis
only. In most cases, there are class loading issues which can sometimes be resolved
but not always.

This is because tRunJob is not designed to work in a Service/Route
style (ESB) deployment, so regular support is not provided if you decide to use it,
even though it may work in many cases. If you used tRunJob in the
past, it is recommended to change your Job Design to use Joblets instead.

For DI and non-ESB use cases, it is still a valuable component and has support.

## Basic settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Schema and Edit Schema | * A schema is a row description. It defines the number of fields   (columns) to be processed and passed on to the next component. When you create a Spark   Job, avoid the reserved word `line` when naming the   fields.  Click Edit   schema to make changes to the schema. If the current schema is of the Repository type, three options are available:    + View schema: choose this     option to view the schema only.   + Change to built-in property:     choose this option to change the schema to Built-in for local changes.   + Update repository connection:     choose this option to change the schema stored in the repository and decide whether     to propagate the changes to all the Jobs upon completion.  If you just want to     propagate the changes to the current Job, you can select No upon completion and choose this schema metadata     again in the Repository Content     window. This component offers the advantage of the   dynamic schema feature. This allows you to retrieve unknown columns from source   files or to copy batches of columns from a source without mapping each column   individually. For further information about dynamic schemas, see [Dynamic schema](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/dynamic-schema).  This   dynamic schema feature is designed for the purpose of retrieving unknown columns of a   table and is recommended to be used for this purpose only; it is not recommended for the   use of creating tables. * Built-In: You create and store the schema locally for this component   only. * Repository: You have already created the schema and stored it in the   Repository. You can reuse it in various projects and Job designs. |
| Copy Child Job Schema | Click to fetch the child Job schema. |
| Use dynamic job | Select this check box to allow multiple Jobs to be called and processed. When this option is enabled, only the latest version of the Jobs can be called and processed. An independent process will be used to run the subJob. The Context and the Use an independent process to run subJob options disappear. Information noteWarning:  * The Use dynamic job option is not compatible with   the Talend JobServer cache. Therefore, the execution may fail if you run a Job that   contains tRunjob with this check box selected in   Talend Administration Center. * This option is incompatible with the Use or register a shared   DB Connection option of database connection components.   When tRunJob works together with a database   connection component, enabling both options will cause your Job to   fail. * This option is not supported within ESB Routes or Data Services. * To avoid incompatibility with continuous integration, we recommend   clearing this check box when using tRunJob in Joblets. |
| Context job | This field is visible only when the Use dynamic job option is selected. Enter the name of the Job that you want to call from the list of Jobs selected. |
| Job | Select the Job to be called in and processed. Make sure you already executed once the Job called, beforehand, in order to ensure a smooth run through tRunJob. |
| Version | Select the child Job version that you want to use. |
| Context | If you defined contexts and variables for the Job to be called by this component, select the applicable context entry from the list. |
| Use an independent process to run subJob | Select this check box to use an independent process to run the subJob. This helps in solving issues related to memory limits. Information noteWarning:  * This option is not compatible with the Talend JobServer cache. Therefore, the execution may fail if you run a Job that   contains tRunJob with this check   box selected in Talend Administration Center. * This option is incompatible with the Use or   register a shared DB Connection option of database   connection components. When tRunJob works together with a database connection   component, enabling both options will cause your Job to fail. * This option is not supported within ESB Routes or Data Services. |
| Die on child error | Clear this check box to execute the parent Job even though there is an error when executing the child Job. |
| Transmit whole context | Select this check box to get all the context variables from the parent Job. Deselect it to get all the context variables from the child Job. If this check box is selected when the parent and child Jobs have the same context variables defined:  * variable values for the parent Job will be used during   the child Job execution if no relevant values are defined in the   Context Param table. * otherwise, values defined in the Context Param table will be used during   the child Job execution. |
| Context Param | You can change the value of selected context parameters. Click the [+] button to add the parameters defined in the Context view of the child Job. For more information on context parameters, see [Using contexts and variables](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/contexts-and-variables). The values defined here will be used during the child Job execution even if Transmit whole context is selected. |

## Advanced settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Propagate the child result to the output schema | Select this check box to propagate the output data stored in the buffer memory via the tBufferOutput component in the child Job to the output component in the parent Job. This property takes effect only when there is data coming from an input component such as tFixedFlowInput. This check box is cleared by default. It is invisible when the Use dynamic job or Use an independent process to run subJob check box is selected. |
| Print Parameters | Select this check box to display the internal and external parameters in the Console. |
| JVM Setting | Set JVM settings for the Job to be called or processed. * Use child Job JVM arguments: select this option to   use the Child Job JVM arguments. * Overwrite child Job JVM arguments: select this   option to use customized JVM arguments. To added a customized argument,   click the plus button under the JVM frame and edit   the new line added in the frame. |
| Use dynamic context for subJob | Select this option to specify a context variable group for the subJob to be called. After selecting this option, enter a variable name in the text field to the right of this option. Note that the value of the variable needs to be the name of an existing context variable group. Information noteNote: This option take precedence over the Context option in the Basic settings view. |
| Use extra classpath for subJob | Select this option to specify extra class paths for the subJob to be called. After selecting this option, provide one or multiple class paths in the text field to the right of this option. If you provide multiple paths, separate the paths using `;` (for Windows) or `:` (for Linux). Information noteNote: This option is available when Use dynamic job or Use an independent process to run subjob is selected in the Basic settings view. |
| Load context parameters from file | Select this check box to create a temporary file where the context parameters used in the Job are written. The child Job then reads the temporary file to retrieve context parameters, and the file is deleted at the end of the execution. Spark local execution is the only supported mode for Spark Batch and Spark Streaming Jobs as the temporary file is created on the local machine. The distributed Job cannot load the temporary file from the client node.  Information noteNote: This option is available when Use dynamic job or Use an independent process to run subjob is selected in the Basic settings view. |
| Use Base64 (for byte[]) | This option is selected by default and makes sure the Base64 encoding scheme is used to transfer byte arrays. |
| tStatCatcher Statistics | Select this check box to gather the processing metadata at the Job level as well as at each component level. |

## Global Variables

| Variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Global Variables | ERROR\_MESSAGE: the error message generated by the component when an error occurs. This is an After variable and it returns a string. This variable functions only if the Die on error checkbox is cleared, if the component has this checkbox.  CHILD\_RETURN\_CODE: the return code of a child Job. This is an After variable and it returns an integer.  CHILD\_EXCEPTION\_STACKTRACE: the exception stack trace from a child Job. This is an After variable and it returns a string.  A Flow variable functions during the execution of a component while an After variable functions after the execution of the component.  To fill up a field or expression with a variable, press Ctrl+Space to access the variable list and choose the variable to use from it.  For more information about variables, see [Using contexts and variables](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/contexts-and-variables). |

## Usage

| Usage guidance | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Usage rule** | This component can be used as a standalone Job or can help clarifying complex Job by avoiding having too many subJobs all together in one Job. If you want to create a reusable group of components to be inserted in several Jobs or several times in the same Job, you can use a Joblet. Unlike the tRunJob, the Joblet uses the context variables of the Job in which it is inserted. For more information on Joblets, see [What is a Joblet](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/what-is-joblet).  This component also allows you to call a Job of a different framework, such as a Spark Batch Job or a Spark Streaming Job. |
| Connections | Outgoing links (from this component to another): Row: Main. Trigger: On Subjob Ok; On Subjob Error; Run if; On Component Ok; On Component Error Incoming links (from one component to this one):  Row: Main; Reject; Iterate. Trigger: On Subjob Ok; On Subjob Error; Run if; On Component Ok; On Component Error; Synchronize; Parallelize. For further information regarding connections, see [Using connections in a Job](/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/using-connections-in-job). |

# Propagating the buffered output data from the child Job to the parent Job

Last updated: 9/30/2026

In this scenario, a three-component Job calls a two-component child Job and displays
the buffered output data of the child Job, instead of the data from the input flow of
the parent Job, on the console.

   to Edit schema to open the Schema dialog box where you can configure the schema
   manually.
9. In the dialog box, click the [+] button to add columns and name them according to the input file
   structure. 

   In this example, this component will actually read files defined in the parent
   Job, and these files contain up to five columns. Therefore, add five string type
   columns and name them `Column1`,
   `Column2`, `Column3`,
   `Column4`, and `Column5`
   respectively, and then click OK to validate
   the schema configuration and close the Schema
   dialog box.
10. Double-click the tLogRow
